- VCs: Thorough due diligence (2-8 weeks)

**Your goal:** Have everything organized and ready to share instantly

## Red Flags Investors Look For

**Avoid these deal-killers:**

❌ **Messy cap table** - Multiple outstanding SAFEs at different caps, unclear ownership
❌ **Founder disputes** - Co-founders who don't get along or have unclear equity splits
❌ **IP issues** - Founder created product before incorporating, no IP assignment
❌ **Over-valuation** - $10M cap for pre-revenue solo founder
❌ **Unrealistic projections** - "We'll be $100M ARR in year 3" with no plan
❌ **Legal problems** - Pending lawsuits, regulatory violations
❌ **Missing documents** - Can't provide basic legal/financial docs
❌ **Inconsistent story** - Pitch deck says one thing, financials say another
❌ **Slow response** - Taking weeks to provide requested documents
❌ **Hidden information** - Not disclosing known risks or problems

5. **Practice answers** (to common diligence questions)

### During Due Diligence

1. **Respond quickly** (within 24-48 hours)
2. **Be transparent** (disclose problems upfront, don't hide)
3. **Stay organized** (track all requests in spreadsheet)
4. **Keep founder aligned** (if multiple founders, ensure consistent answers)
5. **Don't oversell** (be realistic about risks and challenges)

### After Closing

1. **Send thank you** (to investor and their team)
2. **Set update cadence** (monthly investor updates)
