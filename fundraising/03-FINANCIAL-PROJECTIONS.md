## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Year | Sales & Marketing Spend | New Customers | CAC |
|------|-------------------------|---------------|-----|
| Year 1 | $[amount] | [#] | $[amount] |
| Year 2 | $[amount] | [#] | $[amount] |
| Year 3 | $[amount] | [#] | $[amount] |
| Year 4 | $[amount] | [#] | $[amount] |
| Year 5 | $[amount] | [#] | $[amount] |

**CAC Reduction:** $[Y1] → $[Y5] due to channel maturity and economies of scale

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Average MRR** | $[amount] | Blended across all tiers |
| **Average Customer Lifespan** | [X] years | Based on [industry benchmarks / assumptions] |
| **Total Revenue per Customer** | $[amount] | $[MRR] × [months] |
| **Gross Margin** | [X]% | Standard SaaS margin |
| **LTV** | $[amount] | Total revenue × gross margin |

---

### LTV/CAC Ratio

| Year | LTV | CAC | LTV/CAC Ratio |
|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| Year 1 | $[amount] | $[amount] | [X]x |
| Year 2 | $[amount] | $[amount] | [X]x |
| Year 3 | $[amount] | $[amount] | [X]x |
| Year 4 | $[amount] | $[amount] | [X]x |
| Year 5 | $[amount] | $[amount] | [X]x |

**Target:** LTV/CAC > 3x (healthy SaaS)
**Actual:** [X-Y]x (strong/excellent unit economics)

---

### CAC Payback Period

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **CAC** | $[amount] | Cost to acquire one customer |
| **Monthly Gross Margin** | $[amount] | $[MRR] × [X]% margin |
| **CAC Payback Period** | CAC / Monthly Margin | **[X] months** |

**Industry Benchmark:** 12-18 months
**Our Target:** [X-Y] months

## 📝 How to Use This Template

1. **Transfer to Excel/Google Sheets** with formulas
2. **Customize all assumptions** to match your business model
3. **Link cells** so changes propagate (e.g., MRR × 12 = ARR)
4. **Add monthly detail** for Year 1-2 (quarterly for Year 3-5)
5. **Create charts:**
   - ARR growth over time
   - Customer acquisition funnel
   - Burn rate vs. runway
   - Path to profitability
6. **Scenario planning:** Build best/worst/expected cases
7. **Keep updated:** Revise quarterly as actuals come in

**Tips for Investors:**
- Be conservative with growth assumptions
- Show you understand your unit economics
- Explain how you'll achieve profitability
- Demonstrate capital efficiency (low burn, high output)
- Have sensitivity analysis ready for tough questions
