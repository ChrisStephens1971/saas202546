## What is a Cap Table?

A **Capitalization Table (Cap Table)** tracks who owns what percentage of your company.

**Tracks:**
- Founders
- Employees (with stock options)
- Investors (angels, VCs)
- Advisors
- SAFEs / convertible notes (before conversion)

**Why it matters:**
- Know who owns what % at any time
- Calculate dilution from new investments
- Required for fundraising (investors want to see it)
- Legal requirement for issuing equity

## Simple Cap Table Template

### Current State (Pre-Investment)

| Shareholder | Share Class | Shares Owned | % Ownership | Value (if valued) |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Founder Name] | Common Stock | 10,000,000 | 100.00% | $0 (pre-revenue) |
| **Total Outstanding** | | **10,000,000** | **100.00%** | |

**Notes:**
- Single founder holds all shares
- No investors yet
- No employee options issued yet

---

### After $[Amount] SAFE at $[Cap] (Unconverted)

**SAFEs don't convert until priced round, so cap table shows them separately:**

####Outstanding Equity

| Shareholder | Share Class | Shares Owned | % Ownership |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| [Founder Name] | Common Stock | 10,000,000 | 100.00% |
| **Total Outstanding** | | **10,000,000** | **100.00%** |

#### SAFEs (Unconverted)

| Investor | Investment | Valuation Cap | Discount | Date | Status |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|------|--------|
| [Investor Name] | $[amount] | $[cap] | [X]% | 2025-11-14 | Unconverted |

**Estimated Post-Conversion Ownership (at Series A @ $[Next Round Valuation]):**

| Shareholder | Estimated % | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Founder | ~[X]% | Depends on Series A terms |
| SAFE Investor | ~[X]% | Converts at $[cap] cap |
| Series A Investor | ~[X]% | Assuming $[amount] raise |

---

### After Series A ($[Amount] at $[Pre-Money])

**SAFEs convert, Series A closes:**

| Shareholder | Share Class | Shares Owned | % Ownership | Investment | Value @ $[Post-Money] |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Founder | Common | 10,000,000 | [X]% | $0 | $[amount] |
| SAFE Investor | Series A Preferred | [#] | [X]% | $[amount] | $[amount] |
| Series A Lead | Series A Preferred | [#] | [X]% | $[amount] | $[amount] |
| **Total** | | **[total shares]** | **100.00%** | **$[total raised]** | **$[post-money]** |

**Dilution:**
- Founder dilution: 100% → [X]% ([X]% given up)
- Total capital raised: $[amount]
- Post-money valuation: $[amount]

## Cap Table Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Update immediately** after every equity transaction
2. **Keep it simple** in early stages (Excel is fine until Series A)
3. **Use professional tools** (Carta, Pulley) when you have 10+ shareholders
4. **Share with investors** - transparency builds trust
5. **Include option pool** in fully diluted calculations
6. **Model dilution** before raising new rounds
7. **Get 83(b) elections** filed for all founders (within 30 days)

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't let it get messy** - outdated cap tables kill deals
2. **Don't forget advisors** - track their equity too
3. **Don't ignore vesting** - unvested shares shouldn't count as fully owned
4. **Don't miscalculate dilution** - use fully diluted share count
5. **Don't delay updates** - update within 1 week of any transaction
6. **Don't lose track of SAFEs** - they convert eventually
7. **Don't forget liquidation preferences** - track these carefully

## Key Terms to Track

### Share Classes
- **Common Stock:** Founders, employees (via options)
- **Preferred Stock:** Investors (Series A, B, C, etc.)
- **Options:** Employee equity (not yet exercised)

### Vesting
- **Standard:** 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- **Cliff:** No shares vest until 1 year
- **Acceleration:** Vesting speeds up (e.g., on acquisition)

### Dilution
- **Pre-Money Valuation:** Company value before investment
- **Post-Money Valuation:** Company value after investment
- **Fully Diluted:** Includes all options, SAFEs, convertible notes

### Liquidation Preferences
- **1x:** Investors get investment back first, then participate in remaining
- **Participating:** Investors get preference + pro-rata share
- **Non-Participating:** Investors choose preference OR pro-rata share
