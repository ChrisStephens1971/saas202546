## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Sending Pitch Deck in First Email

**Wrong:** "Here's my 20-slide pitch deck attached"
**Right:** "Here's a 1-page summary. Happy to send full deck if interested"

**Why?** Investors get 100+ decks/week. They won't read yours unless you give them a reason.

---

### Mistake 2: Not Practicing Your Pitch

**Wrong:** Winging it, reading slides verbatim
**Right:** Practice 10+ times, tell a story, engage audience

**Why?** First impression matters. Confidence comes from preparation.

---

### Mistake 3: Overvaluing Your Company

**Wrong:** "$10M valuation for pre-revenue solo founder"
**Right:** "$2M cap SAFE, leaves room for Series A upside"

**Why?** Overvaluing scares away investors. Better to raise at fair terms quickly.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Being Ready for Due Diligence

**Wrong:** "Uh, I don't have that document. Let me get back to you in 2 weeks."
**Right:** "Yes, here's the link to our data room. All documents are there."

**Why?** Slow response = loss of momentum. Investors move on.

---

### Mistake 5: Talking Too Much About Product, Not Enough About Market

**Wrong:** "Let me show you every feature in detail for 30 minutes"
**Right:** "The market is $X billion. Here's the pain point. Here's our solution (2 min demo)."

**Why?** Investors care about market size > product features.
