# 👋 Welcome to saas202546!

**Created:** 2025-11-14
**Project Path:** C:\devop\saas202546

---

## 🎉 Your Project is Ready!

This project has been created with a complete planning and documentation structure. Everything you need to plan, build, and ship your SaaS is here.

---

## 🚀 Three Steps to Get Started

### 1. Get Oriented (2 minutes)

**What you have:**
- ✅ Complete folder structure for planning and documentation
- ✅ Templates ready to use
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ VS Code workspace configured

**Where things are:**
- `product/` - PRDs, roadmaps, features
- `sprints/` - Sprint plans, user stories
- `technical/` - Tech specs, ADRs, API docs
- `business/` - OKRs, metrics, goals
- `meetings/` - Notes, interviews

### 2. (Optional) Add Your Initial Vision

**Have a project brief ready?**

Open `project-brief/brief.md` and paste your vision. You can also add:
- `project-brief/vision.md` - Long-term vision
- `project-brief/target-users.md` - User personas
- Or create your own `.md` files in `project-brief/`

Claude automatically reads ALL files in `project-brief/` during planning!

**Or skip this** - Claude will ask you questions.

### 2.5. Understanding Your Tools (Important!)

**✅ Good news: Most tools are BUILT-IN!**

Claude Code comes with powerful built-in tools that require ZERO setup:
- **File operations** (Read, Write, Edit, Search)
- **Specialized agents** (Explore codebase, Plan implementation)
- **Web research** (WebSearch, WebFetch)
- **Task management** (TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion)

**You can start planning immediately with no installation required!**

---

**📦 Optional Extensions (Install Later)**

When you're ready to code or need advanced features:
- **Claude Skills** - Document processing (Excel, PDF, Word)
- **WSHobson Agents** - Framework specialists (React, Python, databases)
- **Claude Code Templates** - Role-based development workflows
- **MCP Servers** - External integrations (analytics, design tools)

**See:** `BUILT-IN-VS-INSTALLABLE.md` for the complete breakdown.

**When to install?** Only when you need them (usually during development, not planning).

### 3. Start Planning

Open Claude Code and say:

> **"Help me get started with this project"**

Claude will guide you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and initial documents.

## 💰 Azure Cost Optimization (Recommended for Dev/Staging)

**Save 60-70% on Azure dev/staging costs with automatic deallocation!**

This template includes **automatic Azure cost optimization** that deallocates VMs and scales down resources after hours.

### Quick Setup (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install Azure SDK
pip install azure-mgmt-compute azure-mgmt-web azure-mgmt-resource azure-identity

# 2. Authenticate with Azure
az login

# 3. Create configuration
cd C:\devop\.template-system\scripts
python create-deallocation-config.py --interactive

# 4. Test (dry run)
python azure-auto-deallocate.py --dry-run --force

# 5. View cost dashboard
python azure-cost-dashboard.py

# 6. Setup automation (PowerShell as Administrator)
.\Setup-AzureDeallocationSchedule.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Deallocates VMs after 8pm weekdays, restarts at 6am
- ✅ Full weekend shutdown (Friday 8pm → Monday 6am)
- ✅ Production protection (never touches production)
- ✅ Real-time cost dashboard
- ✅ Expected savings: ~$47/month per project (60-70%)

**See:** `C:\devop\.template-system\AZURE-AUTO-COST-OPTIMIZATION.md` for complete guide

## 🔧 Technical Implementation (Optional Extensions)

**Planning only?** Skip this section - you have everything you need built-in!

**Ready to code?** Consider installing development extensions:

This project can integrate with:
- **Claude Code Templates** - 163 agents and 210 commands for technical implementation
- **WSHobson Agents** - Framework-specific specialists
- **Claude Skills** - Document processing capabilities
- **MCP Servers** - External service integrations

**See:**
- `BUILT-IN-VS-INSTALLABLE.md` - Understand what's built-in vs. installable
- `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step installation guide
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` - Complete integration documentation

**Remember:** These are OPTIONAL. Built-in tools handle all planning and basic development.
